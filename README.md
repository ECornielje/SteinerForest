- ```IMDC_case_study.ipynb```: Contains the code corresponding to the IMDC paper.
- ```scenario_selection_graph.py```: Contains the code corresponding to Figure 6 in the preprint TULIP paper.
- ```benchmark_dimacs.py```: Contains the code to read the instances from the DIMACS data.

The ```src```-folder contains the following files:
- ```CTSP.py```: Contains the code related to solving the CTSP.
- ```deterministic.py```: Contains the code related to solving the deterministic SSFP.
- ```stochastic.py```: Contains the code related to solving the stochastic SSFP.
